# Learning C
Following examples and advice from [this book](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780789751997/samplepages/0789751992.pdf)


## Lesson 1 Notes

### Brief history of C
Created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1972. It was created for the specific purpose of designing the UNIX operating system. Different versions of C were being used in many different areas, there were some headaches because of this. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee in 1983 to establish a standard definition of C, which became known as ANSI Standard C.

Why the name C? Its predecessor was called B. B was developed by Ken Thompson of Bell Labs. It was named B because of Bell Labs.

Interesting, don't have to label files .c, but it's recommended. Eh, I'm not sure about this. Just tested it and got error
<pre>
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</pre>

### The Compiler
Translates your C code into machine language. The machine language generated by the compiler is called object code, and the disk file containing them is an object file.

My compiler on mac is gcc, installed with X-code

### The Linker
Takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into one executable program.
I believe that the linker is used even with I only write one .c file because it has to link my program with the built-in C libraries. 

My linker on mac is ld. Not really sure how to use this yet.
